# Exercise 5: Adjust the UI Semantics in the Metadata Extensions

## Introduction

In the previous exercise, you've implemented the late numbering for the late numbering for drawing the primary keys of the _travel_ and the _booking_ BO entities at a later time, during the first storing of the data (see [Exercise 4](../ex04/README.md)).

In this exercise, you will adjust the layout of the list reports and object pages of your _Travel_ App by enhancing the metadata extension ![metadataextension](../images/adt_ddlx.png) of the _travel_ and the _booking_ BO entities with UI semantics in form of UI-specific annotations (`@UI`).

#### Develop UI Semantics

> UI-specific CDS annotations can be used to solve the most common UI layout tasks in SAP Fiori elements apps built with RAP.
>
> **Read more**: [Develop UI Specifics](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-abap-restful-application-programming-model/develop-ui-specifics)

#### UI Annotations

> UI annotations represent semantic views on business data through the use of specific patterns that are independent of UI technologies. They can be defined either in the ABAP system using UI-specific ABAP CDS annotations or in the SAP Fiori tools.

#### About the SAP Fiori elements Feature Showcase App for RAP and ABAP CDS

> The SAP Fiori Elements Feature Showcase App for RAP provides a reference technical app that showcases the SAP Fiori Elements UI features which can be implemented using ABAP CDS annotations. The feature showcase app is developed using the ABAP RESTful Application Programming Model (RAP) for oData V4 and is transactional- and draft-enabled.

## Exercise 5.1: Adjust the UI Semantics in the _Travel_ Metadata Extension üí°
[^Top of page](#)

> Adjust the appearence of the generated Fiori elements based Travel App by adding the action **`acceptTravel`**, **`rejectTravel`**, and **`createTravel`**, and specifying a colored-based indication of the overall travel status `OverallStatus` for the _travel_ BO entity.
> üí° There are two (2) ways to complete exercise 5.1:
>
> - **Option 1Ô∏è‚É£**: **This is the recommended option**. Replace the complete source code of the metadata extension ![ddlx icon](../images/adt_ddlx.png)**`ZRAP110_C_TRAVELTP_###`** with the source code provided in the source code document linked below and replace the placeholder **`###`** with your assigned suffix. The changes are marked with an appropriate comment in the source code document.
>   Then **proceed directly with Exercise 5.2**.

  <summary>üîµ Click to expand!</summary>

1.  Open the CDS metadata extension of the projected _travel_ entity ![ddlx icon](../images/adt_ddlx.png)**`ZRAP110_C_TRAVELTP_###`**.

2.  Specify the appearance of both instance actions **`acceptTravel`** and **`rejectTravel`** on the list report and the object page of the _travel_ entity.

    For that, replace the annotation block placed before the element **`TravelID`** with the code snippet provided below as shown on the screenshot.

    ```ABAP
      @UI.lineItem: [
        { position: 10 , importance: #HIGH }
       ,{ type: #FOR_ACTION, dataAction: 'acceptTravel', label: 'Accept Travel' }
       ,{ type: #FOR_ACTION, dataAction: 'rejectTravel', label: 'Reject Travel' }
      ]
      @UI.identification: [
        { position: 10 , importance: #HIGH }
       ,{ type: #FOR_ACTION, dataAction: 'acceptTravel', label: 'Accept Travel' }  //added line
       ,{ type: #FOR_ACTION, dataAction: 'rejectTravel', label: 'Reject Travel' }  //added line
      ]
      @UI.selectionField: [ {
        position: 10
      } ]
    ```

3.  Specify a color-based indicator for the overall status **`OverallStatus`** on the list report and the object page of the _travel_ entity instance. The criticality will be determined by the virtual element **`OverallStatusIndicator`**.

    For that, add the attribute **`criticality`** to the annotations `@UI.lineItem` and `@UI.identification` for the element **`OverallStatus`** as shown on the screenshot.

    ```ABAP
    , criticality: 'OverallStatusIndicator'
    ```

    <img src="images/ex502.png" alt="Travel MDE" width="50%">

4.  Save ![save icon](../images/adt_save.png) (**Ctrl+S**) and activate ![activate icon](../images/adt_activate.png) (**Ctrl+F3**) the changes.

## Exercise 5.2: Adjust the UI Semantics in the _Booking_ Metadata Extension üí°

[^Top of page](#)

> Enhance the _booking_ metadata extension![metadataextension](../images/adt_ddlx.png)**`ZRAP110_C_BOOKINGTP_###`** to change the appearence of the generated Fiori elements based Travel App. You will define the criticality for the booking status (**`BookingStatus`**) and display the virtual element **`RemainingDaysToFlight`** as _progress bar_ on the UI
> üí° There are two (2) ways to complete exercise 5.2:
>
> - **Option 1Ô∏è‚É£**: **This is the recommended option**. Replace the complete source code of the metadata extension ![ddlx icon](../images/adt_ddlx.png)**`ZRAP110_C_BOOKINGTP_###`** with the source code provided in the source code document linked below and replace the placeholder **`###`** with your assigned suffix. The changes are marked with an appropriate comment in the source code document. Then **proceed directly with Exercise 5.3**.

1.  Open the CDS metadata extension ![ddlx icon](../images/adt_ddlx.png)**`ZRAP110_C_BOOKINGTP_###`**.

2.  Specify the virtual element **`BookingStatusIndicator`** as criticality for the booking status by adding the attribute **`criticality`** to the element annotations `@UI.lineItem` and `@UI.identification` for the element `BookingStatus` as shown on the screenshot.

    ```ABAP
    ,criticality: 'BookingStatusIndicator'
    ```

    <img src="images/ex504.png" alt="Booking MDE" width="100%">

3.  Add the virtual element **`RemainingDaysToFlight`** to the list report and the object page, and specify its visualization as _progress bar_ using the annotation **`@UI.dataPoint`**. The virtual elements **`DaysToFlightIndicator`** and **`InitialDaysToFlight`** are respectively specified as its `criticality` and `targetValue`.

    Insert the code snippet below to the metadata extension after the element **`BookingStatus`** as shown on the screenshot.

    ```ABAP
    @UI: {
     dataPoint: { title: 'Days to Flight Indicator',
                  criticality: 'DaysToFlightIndicator',
                  targetValue: #(InitialDaysToFlight),
                  visualization: #PROGRESS  },
    lineItem:       [{ type: #AS_DATAPOINT, position: 110, importance: #HIGH}],
    identification: [{ type: #AS_DATAPOINT, position: 110 }]  }
    RemainingDaysToFlight;
    ```

4.  Save ![save icon](../images/adt_save.png) (**Ctrl+S**) and activate ![activate icon](../images/adt_activate.png) (**Ctrl+F3**) the changes.

## Exercise 5.3: Preview and Test the Enhanced _Travel_ App

[^Top of page](#)

> You can now preview and test the changes by creating a new _travel_ BO instance in the _Travel_ app.
> ‚ö†**Please note**‚ö† that clicking on the **Accept Travel** and **Reject Travel** buttons at this stage will lead to errors on the UI, because they are not yet implemented.

1. Refresh your application in the browser using **F5** if the browser is still open -
   or go to your service binding ![srvb icon](../images/adt_srvb.png)**`ZRAP110_UI_TRAVEL_O4_###`** and start the Fiori elements App preview for the **`Travel`** entity set.
