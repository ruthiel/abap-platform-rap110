# Exercise 6: Implement the Base BO Behavior - Validations

## Introduction

In the previous exercise, you've enhanced the UI semantics of your _Travel_ app by enhancing the metadata extensions (see [Exercise 5](../ex05/README.md)).

In the present exercise, you're going to implement back-end validations, `validateCustomer`, `validateAgency`, and `validateDates`, to respectively check if the customer ID and the agency name that is entered by the consumer are valid, and if the begin date is in the future and if the value of the end date is after the begin date. These validations are only performed in the back-end (not on the UI) and are triggered independently of the caller, i.e. Fiori UIs or EML APIs.

> ℹ Similar validations were already handled in RAP100. Therefore, you will simply adopt the provided source code. We will use the validations for playing around with features such as **determine actions** and **side effects**.

### About Validations

 <details>
  <summary>Click to expand!</summary>
  
A validation is an optional part of the business object behavior that checks the consistency of business object instances based on trigger conditions.

A validation is implicitly invoked by the business object’s framework if the trigger condition of the validation is fulfilled. Trigger conditions can be `MODIFY` operations and modified fields. The trigger condition is evaluated at the trigger time, a predefined point during the BO runtime. An invoked validation can reject inconsistent instance data from being saved by passing the keys of failed instances to the corresponding table in the `FAILED` structure. Additionally, a validation can return messages to the consumer by passing them to the corresponding table in the `REPORTED` structure.

## Exercise 6.1: Implement the Validations of the _Travel_ BO Entity 💡

[^Top of page](#)

> Enhance the behavior implementation class of the _travel_ entity with the business logic for the validation methods **`validateCustomer`**, **`validateAgency`**, and **`validateDates`**.

> 💡 There are two (2) ways to complete exercise 6.1:
>
> - **Option 1️⃣**: **This is the recommended option**. Replace the whole content of your behavior implementation class of the _travel_ entity ![class](../images/adt_class.png)**ZRAP110*BP_TRAVELTP*###** with the provided source code document linked below and replace the placeholder **`###`** with your assigned suffix. Save ![save icon](../images/adt_save.png) and activate ![activate icon](../images/adt_activate.png) the changes, then **procedd directly with Exercise 6.2**.

## Exercise 6.3: Preview and Test the enhanced Travel App

[^Top of page](#)

> Now the SAP Fiori elements app can be tested.

> ⚠**Please note**⚠ that clicking on the **Accept Travel** and **Reject Travel** buttons at this stage will lead to errors on the UI, because they are not yet implemented.

 <details>
  <summary>🔵 Click to expand!</summary>

1.  You can either refresh your application in the browser using **F5** if the browser is still open - or go to your service binding **`ZRAP110_UI_TRAVEL_O4_###`** and start the Fiori elements App preview for the **`Travel`** entity set.

2.  Click **Create** to create a new entry.

3.  For example, select an `Sunshine Travel (70001)` as Agency ID, select a customer by starting to add a name `Theresia`, Nov 20, 2023 as starting date and Nov 16, 2023 as end date. The draft will be updated.

    <img src="images/ex601.png" alt="Preview" width="100%">

4.  Now click **Create**. You should get following error messages displayed:  
    _Begin Date 11/20/2023 must not be after End Date 11/16/2023_ .
