# Exercise 11b: Exposure of RAP Business Events via SAP Event Mesh

## Introduction

In the previous exercise, you've defined and raised a business event in the Travel BO entity in your Travel App ([see Exercise 11](../ex11/README.md)).

In the present scenario your RAP BO acts as event provider, so an event biding and an outbound communication arrangement is required to set up the connection between your system and the SAP Event Mesh.

In this exercise, you will create an event binding.

## <!--

> **DSAG ABAP Development Days 2023**:
>
> â„¹ **Info**: The SAP team has configured the SAP Event Mesh and set up an outbound communication arrangement for the connection between the hands-on system (**D23**) and SAP Event Mesh.
>
> âš  Due to time constraint, you will not implement a consumer app to display the raised events in this hands-on. Instead you will get the possibility to have a look at the sent messages in the **_Event Monitor_** app in the **SAP BTP Cockpit**. This aspect will be handled in another session during the event (day 2).

### About the Consumption of RAP Business Events

> RAP Business events can be consumed in other systems (_remote consumption_) using SAP Event Mesh, or in the same system as they are raised (_local consumption_).

## Exercise 11b.1: Create the Event Binding
[^Top of page](#)

> Now, you will create an event binding (`R3TR EVTB`) for your RAP business event in ADT: ![evt binding icon](../images/adt_evtb.png)**`ZRAP110_E_TRAVEL_ACCEPTED_###`**, where `###` is your group ID.
>
> An event binding represents the design time definition of the event and maps the event defined in a RAP BO to a namespace, a business object and a business object operation like modify or update. It enables you to map the relevant information of an event in order to access the event itself outside of your ABAP system on the SAP BTP event mesh. (Further information, see [Creating Event Bindings](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-abap-development-user-guide/creating-event-bindings))

  1. In the **Project Explorer**, right-click the folder **Business Services** in your package and  select **New** > **Event Binding** from the context menu to launch the creation wizard.

     <img src="../ex11/images/ex1105.png" alt="Travel BO node bdef" width="50%">

  2. Enter the name and the description of the event binding:
     - Name: **`ZRAP110_E_TRAVEL_ACCEPTED_###`**, where ### is your group ID
     - Description: _Accepted Travel Event Binding_

     <img src="../ex11/images/ex1106.png" alt="Travel BO node bdef" width="50%">

     Click **Finish**.

     <img src="../ex11/images/ex1107.png" alt="Travel BO node bdef" width="50%">

  3. In the **General Information** section of the form-based **_Event Bindings Editor_**, enter the *namespace for which the event binding will be available, the name of the external BO, and the name of the external BO operation.

     - Namespace: **`zrap110.a###`** (where `###` is your group ID)
     - Business Object: **`Travel`**
     - Business Object Operation: **`Accepted`**

      <img src="../ex11/images/ex1123.png" alt="Event Binding" width="100%">

     >The **Type** field shows the qualified name of the event type that will be used for the configuration in the SAP BTP Event Mesh. It is automatically derived from the value of the other fields in the following way: `your_namespace.external_business_object.business_object_operation`, i.e. `zrap110.a###.Travel.Accepted.v*` in this exercise.

  4. Now go to the **Events** section and reference the details of the event defined in your behavior definition:

     For that, click **Add...**, enter following information, and then click **Add** :

     - Event Minor version : 1
     - Event Patch version : 0
     - Root Entity Name    : **`ZRAP110_R_TRAVELTP_###`**
     - Event Entity Name   : **`TRAVEL_ACCEPT`**

      You can update these details using the **Add...**, **Edit...**, and **Remove** buttons.

      <img src="../ex11/images/ex1124.png" alt="Event Binding" width="50%">

      Click **Add**.

  5. Save ![save icon](../images/adt_save.png) (**Ctrl+S**) and activate your changes by right-click the event binding and selecting **Activate**.

     <img src="../ex11/images/ex1109.png" alt="Event Binding" width="50%">

  6. Check your result. Now you should be able to see the event binding type.

        - **Event Version** will automatically be generated by the system.
        - **Event Minor Version** defines the semantic minor version of the event.
        - **Event Patch Version** defines the semantic patch version of the event.
        - **Root Entity Name** is the name of the CDS root entity.
        - **Entity Event Name** is the name of the event defined in the behavior definition of the respective CDS root entity.

## Exercise 11b.2: Configure the Event Bindings in SAP Event Mesh
[^Top of page](#)

> The next step is typically to configure the event bindings in the relevant Event Channel of the SAP Event Mesh instance using the _**Enterprise Event Enablement - Configure Channel Binding**_ app in the SAPÂ Fiori Launchpad.
>
> PS: The app name is _**Bereitstellung von Unternehmens-/technischen Ereignissen - Kanalbindung**_ if you're logged in german (DE).
