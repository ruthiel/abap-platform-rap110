# Exercise 9: Enhance the BO Behavior with Side Effects

## Introduction

In the previous exercise, you've implemented determinations in the base BO Behavior (see [Exercise 8](../ex08/README.md)).

In the present exercise, you will define side effects for the _travel_ BO root entity to trigger a reload of the Fiori elements based _Travel_ app.

### About Side Effects

> Side effects are used to trigger data, permission, or message changes based on data changes in UI scenarios with draft-enabled BOs.
>
> They are useful in UI scenarios based on draft-enabled BOs to notify a Fiori Elements UI that data changes of defined fields require the recalculation of other data values, permissions or messages.
>

## Exercise 9.1: Define Side Effects in the base _Travel_ BO Behavior

[^Top of page](#)

> Define Side effects to trigger the recalculation of the total price (`TotalPrice`) each time the fields the booking fee (`BookingFee`), the currency code (`CurrencyCode`), and the flight price (`FlightPrice`) of the _travel_ or the _booking_ entities change on the UI.
>
> Also define Side effects so that begin date (`BeginDate`) and the end date (`EndDate`) of the travel entity are validated each time they are changed.

### Exercise 9.1.1: Define the Side Effects for the base _Travel_ BO Entity

> Define side effects for the fields **`TotalPrice`**, **`BeginDate`**, and **`EndDate`** of the _travel_ entity.

  <details>
  <summary>ðŸŸ£ Click to expand!</summary>

1.  Open the behavior definition of the _travel_ BO entity ![bdef](../images/adt_bdef.png)**`ZRAP110_R_TRAVELTP_###`**.

2.  Define the side effects for the recalculation of the total price.

    Field triggers are the elements **`BookingFee`** and **`CurrencyCode`**, and the field target (or affected field) is the element **`TotalPrice`**.

    Insert the code snippet provided below after the determinations as shown on the screenshot.

    ```ABAP
    //side effects
    side effects
    {
      field BookingFee affects field TotalPrice;
      field CurrencyCode affects field TotalPrice;
    }
    ```

    <img src="images/ex9x1.png" alt="package" width="50%">

3.  Define the side effects to trigger the validation of **`BeginDate`** and **`EndDate`**.

    For that the defined **`determine action checkDates`** defined in [Exercise 3.4](../ex03/README.md#exercise-34-define-the-actions) will be called each time `BeginDate` and `EndDate` are changed. The respective messages should be reloaded whenever available.

    > â„¹ A `determine action` allows you to specify trigger points for when validations and determinations should be invoked.

    Add following code snippet to the **`side effects`** definition as shown on the screenshot:

    ```ABAP
    determine action checkDates executed on field BeginDate, field EndDate affects messages;
    ```

### Exercise 9.1.2: Define the Side Effects for the base _Booking_ BO Entity

> Define side effects for the fields **`TotalPrice`** of the parent _travel_ entity.

  <details>
  <summary>ðŸŸ£ Click to expand!</summary>

1.  Open the behavior definition of the _booking_ BO entity ![bdef](../images/adt_bdef.png)**`ZRAP110_R_TRAVELTP_###`**.

2.  Define the side effects for the recalculation of the total price of the target _travel_ entity each time the flight price or the currency code of the _booking_ entity changes.

    Field triggers are the elements **`FlightPrice`** and **`CurrencyCode`**, and the field target (aka affected field) is the element **`_Travel-TotalPrice`** of the target parent _Travel_ entity.

    (**`_Travel.TotalPrice`**)

    Insert the code snippet provided below after the determinations as shown on the screenshot.

    ```ABAP
    //side effects for a target entity
    side effects
    {
      field FlightPrice affects field _Travel . TotalPrice;
      field CurrencyCode affects field _Travel . TotalPrice;
    }
    ```

    <img src="images/ex9x3.png" alt="package" width="50%">

3.  Save ![save icon](../images/adt_save.png) and activate ![activate icon](../images/adt_activate.png) the changes.

## Exercise 9.2: Expose Side Effects in the _Travel_ BO Projection

[^Top of page](#)

> Now, you have to expose the side effects in the BO behavior projection to enable it on the Fiori elements _Travel_ app.

 <details>
  <summary>ðŸ”µ Click to expand!</summary>

1.  Open the behavior projection of the _Travel_ BO ![bdef](../images/adt_bdef.png)**`ZRAP110_C_TravelTP_###`**.

1.  Insert the code snippet provided below just after the `use draft;` statement as shown on the screenshot.

    ```ABAP
    use side effects;
    ```

    <img src="images/ex904.png" alt="package" width="50%">

1.  Save ![save icon](../images/adt_save.png) and activate ![activate icon](../images/adt_activate.png) the changes.

9.3 - Define Side Effects in the _Travel_ BO Projection

## Exercise 9.3: Define Side Effects in the _Travel_ BO Behavior Projection

[^Top of page](#)

> Now, you will define side effects in the BO behavior projection for the virtual elements defined in the BO projection view: **`DaysToFlightIndicator`**,
> **`InitialDaysToFlight`**, and **`RemainingDaysToFlight`**.
>
> Side effects for elements defined the BO projection layer have to be defined on the same layer. They cannot be defined on the base BO layer.

 <details>
  <summary>ðŸ”µ Click to expand!</summary>

1.  Go to the behavior projection of the _Travel_ BO ![bdef](../images/adt_bdef.png)**`ZRAP110_C_TravelTP_###`**.

2.  Insert the code snippet provided below in the behavior projection of the _booking_ BO entity **`ZRAP110_C_BookingTP_###`** just after the `use delete;` statement as shown on the screenshot.

    ```ABAP
    side effects { field BookingDate affects field DaysToFlightIndicator, field InitialDaysToFlight, field RemainingDaysToFlight;
                   field FlightDate affects field DaysToFlightIndicator, field InitialDaysToFlight, field RemainingDaysToFlight;
                   field ConnectionID affects field DaysToFlightIndicator, field InitialDaysToFlight, field RemainingDaysToFlight;
                   field CarrierID affects field DaysToFlightIndicator, field InitialDaysToFlight, field RemainingDaysToFlight; }
    ```

    <img src="images/ex906.png" alt="BDEF Projection" width="100%">

3.  Save ![save icon](../images/adt_save.png) and activate ![activate icon](../images/adt_activate.png) the changes.

 </details>

## Exercise 9.4: Preview and Test the Enhanced Travel App

[^Top of page](#)

> You can now preview and test the changes by creating a new _travel_ instance with _booking_ instances in the _Travel_ app.

 <details>
  <summary>ðŸ”µ Click to expand!</summary>

1. Refresh your application in the browser using **F5** if the browser is still open -
   or go to your service binding ![srvb icon](../images/adt_srvb.png)**`ZRAP110_UI_TRAVEL_O4_###`** and start the Fiori elements App preview for the **`Travel`** entity set.

2. For example, go to an existing _Travel_ instance or edit an existing one, and change either the booking fee or a booking flight price.

   The total price should be re-calculated directly.

Now that you've...

- defined side effects in the base BO,
- exposed them in the BO projection, and
- tested the enhanced _Travel_ app,

you can continue with the next exercise â€“ **[Exercise 10: Implement the Base BO Behavior - Functions](../ex10/README.md)**
