# Exercise 11: Enhance the BO Behavior with Business Events

## Introduction

In the previous exercise, you've implemented a function for the _booking_ BO entity (see [Exercise 10](../ex10/README.md)).

In this exercise, you will enhance the behavior defintion of the _Travel_ BO entity ![bdef](../images/adt_bdef.png)**`ZRAP110_R_TRAVELTP_###`** with business events. Your RAP BO will act as an event provider. The events will be used to send a message when the overall status of the _Travel_ BO node is changed to _accepted_ or _rejected_ to inform possible consumers about the change.

In this exercise your RAP BO acts as an event provider. For the local event consumption, you will implement a local event handler that acts as an event consumer, listening to and processing events raised by your _Travel_ RAP BO in the same system.

## <!--

> **DSAG ABAP Development Days 2023**:
>
> â„¹ **Info**: The SAP team has configured the SAP Event Mesh and set up an outbound communication arrangement for the connection between the hands-on system (**D23**) and SAP Event Mesh.
>
> âš  Due to time constraint, you will not implement a consumer app to display the raised events in this hands-on. Instead you will get the possibility to have a look at the sent messages in the **_Event Monitor_** app in the **SAP BTP Cockpit**. This aspect will be handled in another session during the event (day 2).

### About Business Events in RAP

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand the details!</summary>
  
> Developers can now define and raise business events in a RAP BO or in a RAP BO behavior extension.
>
> RAP supports event-driven architecture natively on SAP BTP ABAP environment and SAP S/4HANA in the cloud and on-prem as of release 2022. Event-driven architecture enables asynchronous communication between an event provider and an event consumer in use cases where no direct response from the event consumer is required.
>
> Business events provide the opportunity of light-weight, decoupled process integration based on standardized and stable APIs and they are now a native part of the SAP - ABAP RESTful Application Programming Model. With the RAP Business Event Bindings Editor, you can create RAP Event Bindings which are needed to provide a mapping between the definition of RAP Events via behavior definition (BDEF) and the external representation of Business Events.
>
> A RAP BO can act as event consumer or event provider.
> 
> RAP Business events can be consumed in other systems (_remote consumption_), or in the same system as they are raised (_local consumption_).

## Exercise 11.1: Define the Business Event Parameter

[^Top of page](#)

> A RAP Business event can be defined with or without an output parameter. An output parameter is used to transfer values that are not inherently part of the BO data model.
>
> Parameters in RAP are modelled using CDS abtract entity.
>
> In this exercise, you will use the CDS abstract entity ![ddls](../images/adt_ddls.png)**`ZRAP110_A_TRAVEL_###`** available in your exercise package **`ZRAP110_###`**, where **`###`** is your assigned suffix.

<details>
  <summary>ðŸ”µ Click to expand!</summary>
  
  1. Go to the **Project Explorer**, open the CDS abtract view ![ddls](../images/adt_ddls.png)**`ZRAP110_A_TRAVEL_###`** in your package and have a look at its data definition.

      <img src="images/ex1121.png" alt="CDS Abstract Entity" width="50%">

      <details>
        <summary>Source code</summary>

        ```ABAP
          @EndUserText.label: 'Abtract Entity for Travel'
          define abstract entity ZRAP110_A_TRAVEL_###
          {
            travel_id      : /dmo/travel_id;
            agency_id      : /dmo/agency_id;
            customer_id    : /dmo/customer_id;
            overall_status : /dmo/overall_status;
            description    : /dmo/description;
            @Semantics.amount.currencyCode: 'currency_code'
            total_price    : /dmo/total_price;
            currency_code  : /dmo/currency_code;
            begin_date     : /dmo/begin_date;
            end_date       : /dmo/end_date;
            email_address  : /dmo/email_address;
          }
        ```
      <details>

      Beside attributes - such as **`travel_id`**, **`customer_id`**, and **`total_price`** - that can be retrieved from the _Travel_ BO entity, the variable **`email_address`** can contains the e-mail address of an Agency which needs to be informed. The variable **`travel_id`** contains the information about the _travel_ that triggered the event.

2. Close the abstract entity and go ahead with the next step.

## Exercise 11.2: Define the Business Event in the _Travel_ BO

[^Top of page](#)

> Define the events **`travel_accepted`** (with output parameter) and **`travel_rejected`** (without output parameter).
>
> The event **`travel_accepted`** will be defined with the abstract entity ![ddls](../images/adt_ddls.png)**`ZRAP110_A_TRAVEL_###`** as output parameter.

<details>
  <summary>ðŸ”µ Click to expand!</summary>
  
 1. Open the behavior definition of the _travel_ BO entitiy ![bdef](../images/adt_bdef.png)**`ZRAP110_R_TravelTP_###`** in your package.
  
 2. Define the event **`travel_accepted`** using the keyword **`event`** in the behavior definition of the **_Travel_ BO node**, just after the _Side Effects_ as shown on the screenshot below. Replace the placeholder `###` with your assigned suffix.
  
    Insert the code snippet provided below for the purpose after the _side effects_ definition.

    ```ABAP
      //business events
      event travel_accepted parameter ZRAP110_A_Travel_###;
      event travel_rejected;
    ```

    <img src="images/ex1122.png" alt="Travel BO node bdef" width="80%">

3.  Business events must be raised in the save sequence, therefore, we have to enable the _additional save_ for our managed BO by specifying the statement **`with additional save`**

    We will add the keywords **`with full data`** to always have access to all the data of the _travel_ entity instances without having to read them.

    For that, insert the code snippet provided below after the `late numbering` statement,

    ```ABAP
      with additional save with full data
    ```

    <img src="images/ex1102.png" alt="Travel BO node bdef" width="50%">

4.  Save ![save icon](../images/adt_save.png) (**Ctrl+S**) and activate ![activate icon](../images/adt_activate.png) (**Ctrl+F3**) the changes.

    A warning âš  will be displayed about the need for a redefinition of the local saver method `save_modified`. You will tackle this in the next step.

</details>

## Exercise 11.3: Raise the Event in the _Travel_ BO

[^Top of page](#)

> The business events **`travel_accepted`** and **`travel_rejected`** must be respectively raised each time a _travel_ BO entity is accepted or rejected. This can be used, for example, to trigger an email ðŸ“¤ to be sent out to whomever it may concern.
>
> Business events are raised in the additional save of the BO entity for which you want to raise the event, i.e. in the local saver class method **`save_modified`** of the behavior pool ![class](../images/adt_class.png)**`ZRAP110_BP_TRAVELTP_###`** of _Travel_ BO entity in the present scenario.

<details>
  <summary>ðŸ”µ Click to expand!</summary>
  
  1. Go to the behavior pool ![class](../images/adt_class.png)**`ZRAP110_BP_TRAVELTP_###`** and navigate to the local saver class **`lsc_zrap110_r_traveltp_###`** located on the **Local Types** tab.
  
  2. Define the constant **`travel_status`** for the different overall travel status and redefine the method **`save_modified`** in the local saver class definition.
  
     Insert the code snippet provided below in the `PROTECTED SECTION` for the purpose.
  
      ```ABAP
        CONSTANTS:
          BEGIN OF travel_status,
            open     TYPE c LENGTH 1 VALUE 'O', "Open
            accepted TYPE c LENGTH 1 VALUE 'A', "Accepted
            rejected TYPE c LENGTH 1 VALUE 'X', "Rejected
          END OF travel_status.
 
         METHODS save_modified REDEFINITION.
      ```
  
      <img src="images/ex1103.png" alt="Travel BO node bdef" width="50%">  
  
  3. Add the method implementation using the ADT Quick Fix (**Ctrl+1**).
     Select the appropriate entry for the method implementation to be added to the class implementation.

     <img src="images/ex1104.png" alt="Travel BO node bdef" width="50%">

4. Now go to the class implementation section and raise the event with the appropriate information. The appropriate events should be raised only when the overall status of a _travel_ instance is set to _accepted_ or _rejected_.

   For that, replace the empty method implementation of **`save_modified`** with the source code provided below and replace all occurences of the placeholder **`###`** with your assigned suffix using **Ctrl+F**.

   ```ABAP
    METHOD save_modified.
      "send notification for all accepted and rejected travel instances
      IF update IS NOT INITIAL.

        "raise event
        RAISE ENTITY EVENT ZRAP110_R_TravelTP_###~travel_accepted
         FROM VALUE #(
           FOR travel IN update-travel
           WHERE ( %control-OverallStatus EQ if_abap_behv=>mk-on AND
                   OverallStatus          EQ travel_status-accepted )
             "transferred information
             ( %key           = travel-%key
               travel_id      = travel-TravelID
               agency_id      = travel-AgencyID
               customer_id    = travel-CustomerID
               overall_status = travel-OverallStatus
               description    = travel-Description
               total_price    = travel-TotalPrice
               currency_code  = travel-CurrencyCode
               begin_date     = travel-BeginDate
               end_date       = travel-EndDate
             )
           ).

        "raise event
        RAISE ENTITY EVENT ZRAP110_R_TravelTP_###~travel_rejected
         FROM VALUE #(
           FOR travel IN update-travel
           WHERE ( %control-OverallStatus EQ if_abap_behv=>mk-on AND
                   OverallStatus          EQ travel_status-rejected )
             "transferred information
              ( %key = travel-%key )
           ).

      ENDIF.

    ENDMETHOD.
   ```

5. Save ![save icon](../images/adt_save.png) (**Ctrl+S**) and activate ![activate icon](../images/adt_activate.png) (**Ctrl+F3**) the changes.

## Exercise 11.4: Create a Local Event Handler

[^Top of page](#)

> As mentioned in the introduction, RAP business events can be consumed locally in the same system where they are raised (local consumption) or remotely in a separate system using SAP Event Mesh (remote consumption) for the a cross-system communication. The events will be **consumed locally** in this exercise.
>
> For that, you will create an event handler class to locally consume the RAP business events raised by your application, ie. by your RAP BO: ![ABAP class](../images/adt_class.png)**`ZRAP110_TRAVEL_EVENT_HANDL_###`**, where `###` is your assigned suffix. In this exercise, the event handling will simply consist of persisting the received information to a database table.

<details>
  <summary>ðŸ”µ Click to expand!</summary>

1. First create a database table with a UUID-based primary key to store the received event information.

   For that, right-click the folder **Database Tables** and select **New Database Table** from the context menu to launch the creation wizard.

   <img src="images/ex11x1.png" alt="Travel BO node bdef" width="50%">

   Maintain the required information and click **Next >**.

   - Name: **`ZRAP110_ETRAV###`**, where `###` is your assigned suffix
   - Description: `Travel event data`

   <img src="images/ex11x2.png" alt="Travel BO node bdef" width="50%">

   Select a transport request, and click **Finish** to create the database table.

   <img src="images/ex11x3.png" alt="Travel BO node bdef" width="50%">

2. Replace the default code with the code snippet provided below and replace all occurences of the placeholder `###` with your assigned suffix.

   <pre lang="ABAP">
     @EndUserText.label : 'Travel data'
     @AbapCatalog.enhancement.category : #NOT_EXTENSIBLE
     @AbapCatalog.tableCategory : #TRANSPARENT
     @AbapCatalog.deliveryClass : #A
     @AbapCatalog.dataMaintenance : #RESTRICTED
     define table zrap110_etrav### {
   
       key client     : abap.clnt not null;
       key uuid       : sysuuid_x16 not null;
       travel_id      : /dmo/travel_id not null;
       agency_id      : /dmo/agency_id;
       customer_id    : /dmo/customer_id;
       event_name     : /dmo/description;
       overall_status : /dmo/overall_status;
       created_at     : abap.utclong;
     }
   </pre>

   <img src="images/ex11x4.png" alt="Travel BO node bdef" width="50%">

3. Save ![save icon](../images/adt_save.png) (**Ctrl+S**) and activate ![activate icon](../images/adt_activate.png) (**Ctrl+F3**) the changes.

4. Now go ahead, create, and implement the event handler class for the local event consumption.

   For that, go to the **Project Explorer**, right-click the folder **Classes** in your package, and select **New ABAP Classes** from the context menu to launch the creation wizard.

   <img src="images/ex11x5.png" alt="Travel BO node bdef" width="50%">

   Maintain the required information and press **Finish**.

   - Name: **`ZRAP110_TRAVEL_EVENT_HANDL_###`**, where `###` is your assigned suffix
   - Description: _Travel event handler for local consumption_

   <img src="images/ex11x6.png" alt="Travel BO node bdef" width="50%">

   Select a transport request, and click **Finish** to create the ABAP class.

   <img src="images/ex11x7.png" alt="Travel BO node bdef" width="50%">

5. Specify the class as event handler class pool for your RAP BO by adding the statement **`FOR EVENTS OF entity_name`** of the class definition section, directly after the keyword **`FINAL`** as shown on the screenshot. Do not forget to replace all occurences of **`###`** with your assigned suffix.

   <pre lang="ABAP">
        FOR EVENTS OF ZRAP110_R_TRAVELTP_###
   </pre>

   <img src="images/ex11x8.png" alt="Travel BO node bdef" width="50%">

   You can now go ahead with the event handler implementation.

6. Now go to the **Local Types** tab to define and implement the local handler class **`lhe_travel`** for the _travel_ BO entity.

   For that, simply replace the skeleton code with the source code provided in the document below. You can access the ABAP Keyword documentation (**F1**) for more details on the classes `cl_abap_behavior_event_handler` and `cl_abap_tx` used in the implementation.

   Do not forget to replace all occurences of the placeholder **`###`** with your assigned suffix.

   â–¶ðŸ“„ **Source code document:** ![class](../images/adt_class.png)[Local Types of ABAP Class ZRAP110*TRAVEL_EVENT_HANDLER*###](sources/EX11_CLASS_ZRAP110_TRAVEL_EVENT_HANDLER_LocalTypes.txt)

   **Brief explanation of the local RAP event handler class `lhe_travel`**
     <details>
      <summary>Click to expand!</summary>

   1. A local event handler class must inherit from the superclass **`cl_abap_behavior_event_handler`**.

   2. Our current local event handler contains a RAP event handler method for each event we whant to handle:

      - i.e. **`on_travel_accept()`** and **`on_travel_reject()`** for the events `travel_accepted` and `travel_rejected` respectively, in this exercise.
      - In the method signature, the importing parameter, the entity, as well as the event to be consumed are specified.

      > **Note**: An event can only be handled by one method within an event handler class. However, method handling across multiple handler classes is possible.

   3. In this exercise, the method **`get_uuid()`** is used for convenience to centrally generate UUIDs for the new database records to be persisted.

   4. About the implementation of the RAP event handler methods: **`on_travel_accept()`** and **`on_travel_reject()`**
      - Because we are doing an insert on a database, we must first close the active modify phase of the RAP LUW by calling the method `cl_abap_tx=>save()`.
      - Loop over the transfered event instances and do the needful ðŸ™‚

     </details>

7. Save ![save icon](../images/adt_save.png) (**Ctrl+S**) and activate ![activate icon](../images/adt_activate.png) (**Ctrl+F3**) the changes.

 </details>

## Exercise 11.5: Test the Enhanced _Travel_ App

[^Top of page](#)

> Now play aroud with your _Travel_ app and check out whether the raised events were process by the event handler class and the respective information persisted in the database table **`ZRAP110_ETRAV###`**.

<details>
  <summary>ðŸ”µ Click to expand!</summary>

1.  First, start the Data Preview (F8) of the new database table `ZRAP110_ETRAV_###`. No data should be shown as it is empty.

    <img src="images/ex11x9.png" alt="???" width="100%">

2.  Now, go to your _Travel_ app, and, for example, set a Travel record to _accepted_ and another one to _rejected_.

    <img src="images/ex11x12.png" alt="???" width="100%">

    <img src="images/ex11x13.png" alt="???" width="100%">

    <img src="images/ex11x10.png" alt="???" width="100%">

3.  Go back to the ABAP Development Tools and refresh the Data Preview of the database table `ZRAP110_ETRAV_###`.

    Entries of the raised events should now appear on the screen.

    <img src="images/ex11x11.png" alt="???" width="100%">

4.  You can repeat the test: Play around in the _Travel_ app and check the new entries in the database table `ZRAP110_ETRAV_###`.

</details>

## Summary
